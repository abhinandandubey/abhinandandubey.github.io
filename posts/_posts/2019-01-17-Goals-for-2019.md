I always have a goal for the year. 2015, being the year for academics, 2016 for great changes, 2017 for challenges in establishing myself on my own, and 2018 to sustain on my own, learn French, and improve my lifestyle.


I plan 2010 to be a revival of my career and want it to be the most productive year I've ever lived through.
