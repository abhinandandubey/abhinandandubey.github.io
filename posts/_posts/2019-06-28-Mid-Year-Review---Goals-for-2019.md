It's almost July and I think it's perfect time to see where I am with my goals

Here were the goals I set in the beginning of the year, I am going to modify and add to them.

- [ ] Learn French Level A2, B1 and B2 - Working on it
- [ ] Get a Learner's License - Unfortunately this has no progress.
- [x] Get an onsite at FAANG
- [ ] Save at least 20,000$ in savings - Maybe there - We'll see. I'm trying to save more. Do have a few unhappy purchases.
- [ ] Read: ~~The Storyteller's Secret~~ The book's really boring and not what I expected at all. I might read it later. I'm instead setting this goal to _Read atleast 5 Historical Fiction books_
- [ ] Read: Guns, Germs and Steel
- [ ] Be better at European History - No progress here, I am going to formalize it so that it's more trackable - I should know the basic timeline of events.
- [ ] Solve at least 400 Leetcode Problems - I am mostly doing good on this, I have solved over 230 problems !
- [ ] ~~Complete a Graduate Course at an Ivy~~ - I am going to cross this off now, because of time and financial constraints. Instead, I'm adding a Coursera Specialisation - "Parallel, Concurrent, and Distributed Programming in Java" - Rice University - It's cheap and polishes on some Java concepts which I really need, coming from Scala and Java world. I'll also try to fit in Data Systems from ASU.
- [x] Family Trip on East Coast - Highlight of the year ! :)
- [ ] Read: The Road from the Past - Read a few pages !
- [ ] Write at least 40 Blog Posts - It's slightly short of 15. Will try to improve here
- [ ] Weigh no more than 130 pounds. - I'm down from 165 to 155 - I'm keeping up with my eat healthy, stay fit goal

I'm going to add these goals:

- [ ] Learn to play the Violin - I'm taking classes at the Little Mozart School of Violin !
- [ ] Learn to Swim - Starting soon at the British Swim School !
- [ ] Volunteer at NYC Pride 2019 ðŸŒˆ - Confirmed !
- [ ] Have at least 2000 Mindfulness Minutes ðŸ§˜
- [ ] Complete 2 Coursera Specializations

Good luck to me !
