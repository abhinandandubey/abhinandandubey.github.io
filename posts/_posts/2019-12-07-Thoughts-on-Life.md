Of late, my life has pretty much taken a really unexpected turn. It's been like a rollercoaster. I've experienced some very highest levels of joy and some really painful moments stitched together like a colorblock scarf. 

It was 7 in the morning, I woke up looking out of the window, the cold blue weather outside as if someone had literally sucked out the summer and shine out of the sky. Tears start pouring from my eyes. I reach out to my phone and message my friend who I've been talking to almost 7 years now and I tell him I have to pee and I am unable to get out of my bed. All I can think of is how beautiful my mornings used to be - I used to text him Good Morning, and he used to do it the first thing waking up. 

I haven't been able to focus at work, I realized I have been phasing out when someone talks to me, and I never feel like I need to eat - at all. All I can do is think about how my life was centered around the person I cared for the most - and how now that I have lost him - my life has lost its meaning. 

Luckily enough, my doctor had called me before to set up an appointment for my physical check-up which was long due, and I have to visit her the next day. 

I am at the Doctor's, filling out a form which asks me questions like "How interested have you been in doing things in past two weeks?" - Little Interest - No Interest. And given how depressed I've been I tick all the saddest boxes. Yes, I've had suicidal thoughts. Yes, I've been feeling like my life has no meaning.

As soon as the Doctor enters the room, she asks me how have I been lately - and that was enough to break me into tears. I am having trouble thinking about coming out to my family, I am not able to digest the fact that my boyfriend has decided to end things with me. I can't take any of it.

She puts me on therapy. She diagnoses me with Medium to Severe Depression due to Adjustment Disorder (AjD).

I did what I had to get my closure, and I felt certainly better. I refused therapy. Although I am having second thoughts. I am trying to fight this battle myself - like I've always done. I'll journal, I'll meditate, I'll go out with new people, I'll try to play the Violin again, I'll crack the hell out Leetcode, I'll blog. I'll give a structure to my day, but I don't want to give up. I literally have no hope that things will get better, or I might find someone I could love anymore, but I don't want that to be the reason for my life being meaningless.

I can't even face the goals I had in my mind for 2019. I clearly sucked. I just see 2020 as my chance of redemption. I want good things to happen, and I want to explore new things. I want to give my life a meaning.

I think although I am not as depressed as I probably was last few weeks, I am in sort of an existential crisis and I am not able to see what do I really want in my life. Life was so much better when I wasn't spoiled by money and when I was still at school. I had ambitions, I wanted to study at an Ivy League, I wanted to pursue a Ph.D., I wanted to do so many things. Now, no matter which way I look it just looks dull. 

I am hoping to cope up with this time and get through this crisis. I will read. I will write, and I will code. I will try hard not to look back.

UPDATE (Dec 8, 2019):

I went to a meditation class at Yoga Shunya, by Robb Kushner, based on the teachings and in the tradition of Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh. It has definitely helped put my mind at ease, and I definitely am feeling better than I was before I went to the class. It's donation driven, and I think I am going to continue attending the class for a while. I am also going to start therapy. Happiness is a butterfly and life doesn't always give you what you want. And it's all about making your peace with it, and moving on. I am trying to do the same, and I will continue to do it until my mind is at ease.
