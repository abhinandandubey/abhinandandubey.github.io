### Thought of an Artificial Ecosystem

Lately, maybe because of the Coronavirus scare, and me binge-watching Westworld on HBO, I've been thinking of making my own Artificial Ecosystem - where life starts at the begining, and there are maps or rather nodes spread across a space. All of it is hazy and unclear.

I started my research with ideas of modelling my problem, and that started with the idea of a "CELL". But where does it end, and how does Cell differ - are human cells same as bacterial cells? Are viruses a type of cell?

#### Time to research

I started labelling how exactly the world would look like - maybe there will be some cells, and then how do they become organisms? Hence the hierarchy.

Lets assume we start with a very basic lake with just cells, but how do these cells differ - what are they composed of? So I spent hours trying to learn how cells came up in the first place.

It's actually quite interesting to read about the RNA World Theory - and that everything evolved from a huge bowl of soup - containing a variety of elements and the RNA chains. RNA themselves are comprised of Nucleotides - the bonding particles which form the RNA.
